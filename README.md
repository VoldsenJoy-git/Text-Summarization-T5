# Text Summarization Using T5

## Overview
This project demonstrates how to fine-tune the T5 (Text-To-Text Transfer Transformer) model for abstractive text summarization. The T5 model is a versatile transformer-based model designed to handle various NLP tasks by converting them into text-to-text problems. Here, it is trained to generate concise summaries for long-form text.

## Working Process

1. **Dataset Preparation**:
   - Input texts and their corresponding target summaries are processed into a format suitable for the T5 model.
   - The input texts are tokenized, truncated to fit within the model's input size (maximum 512 tokens), and paired with their respective tokenized summaries.

2. **Model Fine-Tuning**:
   - The pre-trained `t5-small` model is used as the base.
   - Fine-tuning is done using the Hugging Face `Trainer` API, which handles model training, validation, and saving checkpoints.
   - Training configurations include learning rate scheduling, warmup steps, and weight decay to ensure stable and efficient training.

3. **Evaluation**:
   - The model's performance is evaluated after each epoch using a validation dataset.
   - Metrics like BLEU and ROUGE scores can be used to measure the quality of generated summaries.

4. **Text Summarization**:
   - After training, the model takes custom text inputs and generates corresponding summaries.
   - Beam search decoding is used to ensure the generated summaries are coherent and concise.

5. **Optimization**:
   - GPU acceleration is leveraged to speed up training.
   - Configurations like batch size, number of epochs, and model size can be adjusted for better performance or faster results.

## Summary
This project provides a complete pipeline for building a summarization model using T5. It highlights the power of transformer-based architectures in understanding and generating human-like summaries for long-form content. By fine-tuning a pre-trained model, it reduces the need for extensive resources while achieving high-quality results.
